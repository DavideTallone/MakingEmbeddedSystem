# Idea project diagram
● Make a block diagram describing an embedded system you’d like to have or make. Be
imaginative. Reality does not apply here.

# What is this?
It is the concept for an autonomus blimp with thermal and video sensor, for wildfires early detection and prevention.

## What does it do?
It can roam in a predefined area, defined by gps coordinates, searching for hotspot in the vegetation, that could lead to a fire.
When one such hotspot is detected, a ping is sent via radio to the human operator that can then take direct control of the drone to better investigate the situation.
